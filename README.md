# Azure AI Translator demos

Azure AI Translator is a cloud-based machine translation service you can use to translate text and documents with a simple REST API call. The service uses modern neural machine translation technology. The Custom Translator interface allows you to use your translation memory to create customized neural translation systems. The customized translation system can be used to translate text and documents with the Translator service.

## Azure AI capabilities

### Text Translation
Execute text translation between supported source and target languages in real time. Create a dynamic dictionary and learn how to prevent translations using the Translator API.

### Asynchronous Batch Document Translation
Translate batch and complex files while preserving the structure and format of the original documents. Create a glossary to use with document translation. The batch translation process requires an Azure Blob storage account with containers for your source and translated documents.

### Synchronous Document translation
Translate a single document file alone or with a glossary file while preserving the structure and format of the original document. The file translation process doesn't require an Azure Blob storage account. The final response contains the translated document and is returned directly to the calling client.

### Custom Translator
Build customized models to translate domain- and industry-specific language, terminology, and style. Create a dictionary (phrase or sentence) for custom translations.
